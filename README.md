### Tuya Module 32001-000140
The [original WiFi-Module](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1888a35-ba68-4869-9790-71ff8c572931) is an ESP8266 and it's original Tuya firmware can be replaced with Tasmota or esphome. It's case is easy to open and [solderpads for serial connection](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4515421f-4346-4248-aba7-d4db3886ac40) are available.
The wired UART for the connection to the AC's mainboard uses tx_pin: GPIO15 / rx_pin: GPIO13
